        Anyone can be affected by Cyber-Bullying, and it can someone you know.
        So what should you do to help them? For starters, you should be sure that 
        the problem is bullying, and not a joke. If it is happening to you, then you
        should be able to identify if you are being bullied. Next, you could stand up to 
        the bully yourself, telling them to stop, and explaining why it is wrong. If they
        do not listen, then you should let an adult know, or call up a help line. If it
        is really, bad, then the police might get involved. But do not call the police if it is 
        not a big deal.
